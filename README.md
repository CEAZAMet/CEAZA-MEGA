# Welcome to CEAZA mega!
A low power consumption, reliable and expandable Arduino-derivative datalogger for scientists

![alt text](/Images/CM_PINOUT.PNG?raw=true "CEAZA MEGA Board")


# What is the CEAZA mega?
Is a new simple, robust and expandable datalogger Arduino derivative board based in typical makerâ€™s community integrations.  The board was designed and implemented taking into account requirements as low consumption, expandability and integration. Different tests where made so reliability in low temperatures and low energy needs are satisfied. 
Is expected that the scientific community can add this board to their tool set, as this board solves the energy problem and present an easy transition from handmade logger integrations.

CEAZA mega board integrate:
- ATMEGA2560 8-bit microcontroller
- Arduino mega 2560 bootloader for easy Arduino Ide compatibility
- A real time clock (RTC)
- A microSD card socket for data storage
- USB/Serial driver connected to UART0 for program as an Arduino mega or computer serial communication
- Serial RS-232 driver (connected to UART1) 
- Controlled high frequency (2MHz) step down switching regulator MP2451DT-LF-Z configured to deliver 5V and up to 600mA for external sensor
- Built in 10Kohm NTC thermistor for PCB temperature monitoring
- Power source system voltage monitor
- Terminal for direct connection with DS18B20 1-wire digittal temperature sensor
- 3 LEDs on board and external duplicate conection for two of those LEDs
- an ISCP terminal to program with external programer
- 3 expansion terminal for direct wires soldering or easy plug/unplug expansion boards for CEAZA MEGA

Furthermore, all integrated devices, except the main MCU uses a firmware controlled switched power supply in order to optimize de power consumption.


## Documentation
A comprehensive documentation for well undertand, use or modify the CEAZA MEGA board is available in our Wiki. In adition, we share with you the schematics diagrams, adns Arduino example codes.

## Quickstart guide
Plug a 6.5V to 14V dc power supply in the power terminal and connect CEAZA MEGA main board system to the host PC by mini-USB connector, open the Arduino ide software, select the Arduino Mega board and the correspondign COM port.
Open any of examples scketches and upload to the board.
